= Antora Full-Text-Search

Antora Full-Text-Search is a plugin that enables full-text search capabilities for Antora-based documentation sites. 

This project is about to explore different approaches to FTS in Antora.

== Option 1: Lunr

link:https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-lunr-extension[Using Antora Lunr Extension] we're able to parse content, build index and push it to Lunr during build time.

While easy to setup, Lunr index becomes large and can impact the performance of the site, especially for documentation with a significant amount of content. 

Additionally, it requires the entire index to be loaded into the browser.
