# **Brainstorming Full Text Search (FTS) Over Antora HTML in GCS**

## **Potential Approaches & Their Architecture Pros/Cons**

Since you're looking to implement Full Text Search (FTS) outside of Antora’s generated HTML and with documents stored in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**, here are different architectural approaches:

---

## **1. External Search Engine with Preprocessing Pipeline**
### **How It Works**  
- A **Cloud Function, Cloud Run, or Cloud Dataflow** extracts relevant text from the stored HTML in GCS.  
- The extracted content is indexed in an **external search engine** like:
  - **Elasticsearch**
  - **OpenSearch**
  - **Meilisearch**  
- The front-end queries this external search engine for results.  

### **Pros**  
✅ Scales well for large datasets, supporting **fuzzy search, stemming, synonyms, and ranking**.  
✅ Allows **custom ranking strategies** and potential **vector-based search** for semantic queries.  
✅ Open-source options like Meilisearch are **easy to self-host**.  

### **Cons**  
❌ **Requires preprocessing** (stripping HTML, extracting relevant text).  
❌ Can be **resource-intensive** for large-scale indexing.  
❌ Managed services (Elastic Cloud, OpenSearch Service, Meilisearch Cloud) **introduce extra costs**.  

---

## **2. Using Google Cloud Search (GCS + Vertex AI Search)**
### **How It Works**  
- **Google Cloud Search** (or **Vertex AI Search**) is configured to **crawl GCS** and index HTML files.  
- The search API is queried from the front-end for results.  

### **Pros**  
✅ **No need to manage indexing infrastructure**.  
✅ AI-enhanced search with **OCR & NLP** support.  
✅ **Google-native integrations** (IAM, Pub/Sub, etc.).  

### **Cons**  
❌ **Vendor lock-in** (dependent on Google services).  
❌ Limited **custom ranking and query control**.  
❌ **Costs** could be high based on document size & query volume.  

---

## **3. Firestore + Full-Text Indexing with Algolia**
### **How It Works**  
- Extracted text from HTML is stored in **Firestore**.  
- An **Algolia index** is updated when a file is added/modified.  
- Front-end queries Algolia’s **search API** for fast results.  

### **Pros**  
✅ **Super fast real-time search** with **instant ranking**.  
✅ Managed service = **No infra maintenance**.  
✅ Simple **API-driven integration**.  

### **Cons**  
❌ **Algolia’s free tier is limited**, and costs scale with usage.  
❌ **Firestore may not be needed** if only search is required.  
❌ Less customization than **Elasticsearch** or **Meilisearch**.  

---

## **4. BigQuery + Full-Text Search Functions**
### **How It Works**  
- Extracted text is stored in **BigQuery** tables.  
- Queries leverage **BigQuery full-text search functions** (`CONTAINS_SUBSTR`, `REGEXP_CONTAINS`).  
- A periodic **GCS-to-BigQuery job** updates the dataset.  

### **Pros**  
✅ Ideal for **analytical workloads** with search capabilities.  
✅ **No separate indexing infrastructure**.  
✅ Can **integrate with BI tools** for reporting.  

### **Cons**  
❌ Not optimized for **real-time search**.  
❌ Query latency might be **higher** than dedicated search engines.  
❌ Costs scale based on **query volume & processed data size**.  

---

## **5. GCS + Cloud Run Service with SQLite FTS**
### **How It Works**  
- A **Cloud Run service** periodically extracts and indexes HTML using **SQLite’s FTS5**.  
- A lightweight API is exposed for search queries.  

### **Pros**  
✅ **Minimal infrastructure, fully serverless**.  
✅ **Cheap and simple** for small-scale usage.  
✅ **Efficient read-heavy workloads** with SQLite FTS5.  

### **Cons**  
❌ **Not suitable for large datasets** (>GBs of text).  
❌ **Limited scalability** for high search traffic.

## **Final Thoughts**
Would you be interested in **hybrid approaches**, like:  
- Using **BigQuery** for analytics but **Algolia/Elasticsearch** for real-time search?  
- Pre-processing data into **Google Cloud Search** but exposing **alternative search APIs** for more control?
